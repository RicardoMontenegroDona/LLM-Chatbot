# LLM-Chatbot

## Dataset: Porto_DB
Dataset with Porto's information. Data is from Wikipedia
## Notebook: DecoderOnlyChatbot
Contains the code to create a Decoder-only Chatbot.
The idea was not to create the perfect Chatbot, but to test and apply several techniques and ensure that the code works.
The model was trained on a GPU -> NVIDIA 4070 SUPER
## Save the model
When the code is ran the model is saved on "3_SavedModel" folder. The reason for not existing any content in this folder is because the model was to big to upload to github (61 MB). However, when running the notebook in another computer the model will be stored there.
